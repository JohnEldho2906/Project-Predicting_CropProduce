# Agri_Project

# SUMMARY:

#  Developed a regression model to predict crop yield using an agricultural dataset. 
#  Achieved over 90% accuracy with a mean squared error of 0.08 and an RÂ² value of 0.91. 
# Visualized the data using Seaborn and Tableau; cleaned and processed it using NumPy and Pandas. 
# Tested different regression algorithms, ultimately selecting Decision Tree Regressor for its higher performance than other models like Random Forest and linear regression. Pickled the predictive model and deployed it via Render using HTML.
